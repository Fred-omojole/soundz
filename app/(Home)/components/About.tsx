          Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when

          We feel the same way about making Soundz products. The driving force
          behind Soundz is our passion for what we make, and the people we make
          it for.

          Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
          use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
          professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
          and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the
          shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to
          contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
          culture.
